# 7097A-Reseach-Project
This is the gitHub repository for the Research Project Hybrid Optical/Radio Frequency Communication Channel Model. 
The aim of this project is to develop channel attenuation models for a hybrid
RF/FSO communication system. Synthetic data including RF and FSO channel
attenuation and weather parameters including temperature, humidity, visibility,
etc. will be provided. The synthetic data is based on real empirical data obtained
from a hybrid system operating in six cities around the world. The data includes a
comprehensive list of weather conditions including clear, dust storm, fog, drizzle,
rain, snow and showers.
